# StorageIO
StorageIO is a Windows Runtime Component that was written in C++ to allows developers of UWP apps to access every file of the system. FileIO allows the following features:

- Full access to the filesystem (Including hidden and operating system files) on any UWP device.
- Writing and reading files.
- Opening files in stream for further manipulations.
- Archive system for Creation/Extraction.
- Access to the external storage drives.
- It is as easy to use as Windows.Storage API.

This powerful library was developed by myself and [tunip3](https://github.com/tunip3/tunip3).

## Additional details

To use the most of this library, your app must declare the following capabilities:
